Docker is a popular platform used to develop, ship, and run applications inside containers. Containers are lightweight, standalone, and portable software packages that include everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings. Docker provides an easy-to-use interface for creating, managing, and deploying containers.
